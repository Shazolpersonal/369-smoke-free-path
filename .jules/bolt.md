## 2025-03-02 - Array Allocation Overhead in `utils/achievements.ts`
**Learning:** Multiple array allocations (`Object.keys`, `Object.values`) combined with `.filter(...).length` chains create significant memory and processing overhead when counting truthy properties, especially inside critical functions like `getAchievements` which are calculated frequently.
**Action:** Use a single `for...in` loop with ternary addition (e.g., `(bool ? 1 : 0)`) for calculating counts. This approach avoids intermediate array creation and ensures an O(N) single-pass iteration.
